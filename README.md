ITS - Data Discovery Tool

1.  Worked in the Verification group and cooperated with the R&D group in ITS (Intelligent Regression Test Selection), which is a machine learning algorithm in microchip field, given Changelist, select minimal test set with highest likelihood of failure and achieve same or higher quality targets with less machines or licenses
2.  Developed a Data Discovery Tool in Python, which can fully automatically gather facts and perform initial validation for R&D customers to figure out whether their environment is suitable for ITS. greatly increasing the efficiency of the test team to manual implementation
3.  Generated two flows where users can provide their own regression dataset or database, combined with Regex and SQL command to extract data, and did precheck & pre-calculation
4.  Built up an SQLite database to store the extracted user data and a DBhelper for developer to manage database. Reports will be generated based on analysis and feedback will consist of what is missing from regressions

(PS: This folder includes an Intern Experience Sharing and an ITS demo. The Data Discovery Tool is mainly from Page 13-19. Due to company's regulation, the code cannot be shared)
